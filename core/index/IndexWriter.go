// GetReader Expert: returns a readonly reader, covering all committed as well as un-committed changes to
// the index. This provides "near real-time" searching, in that changes made during an IndexWriter
// session can be quickly made available for searching without closing the writer nor calling
// #commit.
//
// Note that this is functionally equivalent to calling {#flush} and then opening a new reader.
// But the turnaround time of this method should be faster since it avoids the potentially costly
// #commit.
//
// You must close the IndexReader returned by this method once you are done using it.
//
// It's <i>near</i> real-time because there is no hard guarantee on how quickly you can get a
// new reader after making changes with IndexWriter. You'll have to experiment in your situation
// to determine if it's fast enough. As this is a new and experimental feature, please report back
// on your findings so we can learn, improve and iterate.
//
// The resulting reader supports DirectoryReader#openIfChanged, but that call will
// simply forward back to this method (though this may change in the future).
//
// The very first time this method is called, this writer instance will make every effort to
// pool the readers that it opens for doing merges, applying deletes, etc. This means additional
// resources (RAM, file descriptors, CPU time) will be consumed.
//
// For lower latency on reopening a reader, you should call
// IndexWriterConfig#setMergedSegmentWarmer to pre-warm a newly merged segment before it's
// committed to the index. This is important for minimizing index-to-search delay after a large
// merge.
//
// If an addIndexes* call is running in another thread, then this reader will only search those
// segments from the foreign index that have been successfully copied over, so far.
//
// NOTE: Once the writer is closed, any outstanding readers may continue to be used.
// However, if you attempt to reopen any of those readers, you'll hit an
// AlreadyClosedException.
